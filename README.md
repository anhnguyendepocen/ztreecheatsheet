# z-Tree Cheat Sheet
A cheatsheet for z-Tree software (Fischbacher, 2007)

This cheatsheet was not intended to be public. I have prepared this file for the students who attended z-Tree programming course that I gave in Istanbul Bilgi University and the course that I gave with Matteo Ploner in Ca' Foscari. Therefore there might be some errors and typos. Please use it with caution.

Any kind of comments and suggestions are welcomed.
